# NOTE :

Due to hardware limitations on my local machine, running large-scale models, particularly in Tasks 4 and 5, has resulted in high memory consumption. As a result, 
the execution either takes a significant amount of time or causes the Jupyter Notebook kernel to crash. Despite optimizing the code and trying multiple approaches,
the limited system resources affected the model's ability to generate high-quality outputs, which may appear slightly blurred. Iâ€™ve still included the best possible
results obtained under these constraints.
For optimal performance, it is recommended to run the models on a machine with a higher GPU memory or through a cloud-based environment like Google Colab or AWS.

Thank you for your understanding.
